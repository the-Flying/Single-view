# THREE-DIMENSIONAL MORPHOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF LEAF FROM A SINGLE IMAGE

## Introduction
This production presents a diffusion model-based method for single-view leaf reconstruction using potato leaves as the experimental subject. In the camera prediction process, combining an explicit point cloud generation technique and an implicit 3D Gaussian rendering technique enables the accurate prediction of camera parameters and the effective capture of leaf phenotypic features. In the synthesis of the 3D model of the leaf, a strategy for optimizing the coarse model UV texture is designed to achieve spatial consistency of texture details. Furthermore, the model was successfully applied to the reconstruction of other crop leaves and lamellar structural objects, and innovatively constructed a leaf reconstruction model with disease characteristics, aiming to provide a reference for the early 3D detection of crop diseases, as well as a reference for the 3D reconstruction and visualization of other lamellar objects.
